0,"Leveraging user-provided translation to constrain NMT has practical significance. Existing methods can be classified into two main categories, namely the use of placeholder tags for lexicon words and the use of hard constraints during decoding. Both methods can hurt translation fidelity for various reasons. We investigate a data augmentation method, making code-switched training data by replacing source phrases with their target translations. Our method does not change the MNT model or decoding algorithm, allowing the model to learn lexicon translations by copying source-side target words. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves consistent improvements over existing approaches, improving translation of constrained words without hurting unconstrained words.",Code-Switching for Enhancing NMT with Pre-Specified Translation,,Data Augmentation for Neural Machine Translation with Hard Lexicon Constraints and Source-side Target Words Using Code-Switched,Improving Neural Machine Translation with Source-side Data Augmentation,Leveraging User-provided Translation to Constrained Neural Words, Data Augmentation for Constrained NMT,Data Augmentation for Constraint-Free Translation of Lexicon Words

3,"Distant-supervised relation extraction inevitably suffers from wrong labeling problems because it heuristically labels relational facts with knowledge bases. Previous sentence level denoise models don't achieve satisfying performances because they use hard labels which are determined by distant supervision and immutable during training. To this end, we introduce an entity-pair level denoise method which exploits semantic information from correctly labeled entity pairs to correct wrong labels dynamically during training. We propose a joint score function which combines the relational scores based on the entity-pair representation and the confidence of the hard label to obtain a new label, namely a soft label, for certain entity pair. During training, soft labels instead of hard labels serve as gold labels. Experiments on the benchmark dataset show that our method dramatically reduces noisy instances and outperforms other state-of-the-art systems.",A Soft-label Method for Noise-tolerant Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction,Entity-Pair Level Denoise for Distant-Supervised Relation Extraction,Entity-Pair Level Denoise for Distant-Supervised Relation Extraction with Soft Label Combination and Joint Score Function,,Entity-Pair Level Denoise for Distant-Supervised Relation Extraction, Entity-pair Level Denoising for Relation Extraction,Entity-Pair Level Denoise for Distant Relation Extraction
4,"We show that it is feasible to perform entity linking by training a dual encoder (two-tower) model that encodes mentions and entities in the same dense vector space, where candidate entities are retrieved by approximate nearest neighbor search. Unlike prior work, this setup does not rely on an alias table followed by a re-ranker, and is thus the first fully learned entity retrieval model. We show that our dual encoder, trained using only anchor-text links in Wikipedia, outperforms discrete alias table and BM25 baselines, and is competitive with the best comparable results on the standard TACKBP-2010 dataset. In addition, it can retrieve candidates extremely fast, and generalizes well to a new dataset derived from Wikinews. On the modeling side, we demonstrate the dramatic value of an unsupervised negative mining algorithm for this task.",Learning Dense Representations for Entity Retrieval,,Dual Encoders for Entity Linking in Dense Two-Towered Datasets: An Unsupervised Negative Mining,Entity Linking via Dual Encoding and Zero-Rank Re-ranking,Learning Entity Linking with Dual Encoders, Unsupervised Entity Linking via Dual Encoders,Entity Linking with a Dual Parser
5,"Are word-level affect lexicons useful in detecting emotions at sentence level? Some prior research finds no gain over and above what is obtained with ngram features—arguably the most widely used features in text classification. Here, we experiment with two very different emotion lexicons and show that even in supervised settings, an affect lexicon can provide significant gains. We further show that while ngram features tend to be accurate, they are often unsuitable for use in new domains. On the other hand, affect lexicon features tend to generalize and produce better results than ngrams when applied to a new domain.",Portable Features for Classifying Emotional Text,Are Affect Lexicons Useful for Sentence Level Emotion Detection?,Are Word-Level Affect Lexicons Useful in Detecting Emotional Sentences at Sentence Level?

Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of regularization for the adaptability of relation extractors.",Employing Word Representations and Regularization for Domain Adaptation of Relation Extraction,Domain Adaptation for Relation Extraction Using Word Embeddings and Word Clustering,,Domain Adaptation of Feature-based Relation Extraction with Word Embeddings and Clustering,Word Embeddings and Clustering for Relative Extraction, Adapting Word Embeddings and Clustering for Out-of-Domain Relation Extraction,Adapting Feature-Based Relation Extraction Systems with Word Embeddings and Clustering
7,"Many natural language processing applications use language models to generate text. These models are typically trained to predict the next word in a sequence, given the previous words and some context such as an image. However, at test time the model is expected to generate the entire sequence from scratch. This discrepancy makes generation brittle, as errors may accumulate along the way. We address this issue by proposing a novel sequence level training algorithm that directly optimizes the metric used at test time, such as BLEU or ROUGE. On three different tasks, our approach outperforms several strong baselines for greedy generation. The method is also competitive when these baselines employ beam search, while being several times faster.",Sequence Level Training with Recurrent Neural Networks,Sequence Level Training for Greedy Generation of Text,Towards a Sequence Level Training Algorithm for Greedy Generation of Natural Language Texts using Beam Search and BLEU,A Sequence Level Training Algorithm for Greedy Text Generation,, Sequence Level Training for Natural Language Generation,Sequence Level Training for Generative Adversarial Learning
8,"In multi-task learning (MTL), multiple tasks are learnt jointly. A major assumption for this paradigm is that all those tasks are indeed related so that the joint training is appropriate and beneficial. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-task learning of shared feature representations among tasks, while simultaneously determining “with whom” each task should share. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer programming and provide an alternating minimization technique to solve the optimization problem of jointly identifying grouping structures and parameters. The algorithm monotonically decreases the objective function and converges to a local optimum. Compared to the standard MTL paradigm where all tasks are in a single group, our algorithm improves its performance with statistical significance for three out of the four datasets we have studied. We also demonstrate its advantage over other task grouping techniques investigated in literature.",Learning with Whom to Share in Multi-task Feature Learning.,Multi-Task Learning of Shared Feature Representations with Alternating Minimization,Multi-task Learning of Shared Feature Representations among Tasks: A Mixed Integer Programming Algorithm and Alternating Minimization,Mixed Integer Programming for Joint Multi-Task Learning of Shared Feature Representations,Joint Multi-Task Learning of Shared Feature Representations, Multi-Task Learning of Shared Feature Representations,

After deriving its properties, we show how its Jacobian can be efficiently computed, enabling its use in a network trained with backpropagation. Then, we propose a new smooth and convex loss function which is the sparsemax analogue of the logistic loss. We reveal an unexpected connection between this new loss and the Huber classification loss. We obtain promising empirical results in multi-label classification problems and in attention-based neural networks for natural language inference. For the latter, we achieve a similar performance as the traditional softmax, but with a selective, more compact, attention focus.",From Softmax to Sparsemax: A Sparse Model of Attention and Multi-Label Classification,,Sparsemax: Sparsemax for Natural Language Inference with Jacobian and Attention-based Neural Networks in Backpropag,Sparsemax: Sparse activation with smooth and convex loss.,Sparsemax: A Segmentation Function for Multi-Label Classification, SparseMax: A Sparse Activation Function for Neural Networks,Sparsemax and Smoothed Convex Loss for Neural Networks
10,"We present a novel transition system for dependency parsing, which constructs arcs only between adjacent words but can parse arbitrary non-projective trees by swapping the order of words in the input.

We instead aim to generate socially-informed timelines that contain both news article summaries and selected user comments.

Automatic evaluations on real-world datasets that cover four complex events show that our system produces more informative timelines than state-of-theart systems.

(2010) using data from the BNC and evaluate it. The implementation is based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational words and applying them to the vectors of their arguments. The evaluation is based on the word disambiguation task developed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive sentences, and on a similar new experiment designed for transitive sentences. Our model matches the results of its competitors in the first experiment, and betters them in the second.

The reward function depends on the hidden goals of both agents, so the agents must infer the other players’ goals from their observed behavior in order to maximize their returns.

We evaluate this approach on three different tasks and show that the agents are able to learn better policies using their estimate of the other players’ goals, in both cooperative and competitive settings.",Modeling Others using Oneself in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,Self Other-Modeling for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Imperfect Information,Self Other-Modeling for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Imperfect Information: Self-Predicting Hidden Goal Actions,,Self Other-Modeling for Multi-Agent reinforcement learning with imperfect information, Self Other-Modeling for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,Self- Other-Modeling for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Imperfect Information
20,"Previous work introduced transition-based algorithms to form a unified architecture of parsing rhetorical structures (including span, nuclearity and relation), but did not achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose that transition-based model is more appropriate for parsing the naked discourse tree (i.e., identifying span and nuclearity) due to data sparsity. At the same time, we argue that relation labeling can benefit from naked tree structure and should be treated elaborately with consideration of three kinds of relations including within-sentence, across-sentence and across-paragraph relations. Thus, we design a pipelined two-stage parsing method for generating an RST tree from text. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on span and nuclearity identification.",A Two-Stage Parsing Method for Text-Level Discourse Analysis,Pipelined Two-Stage Parsing of Named Discourse Trees,"Transition-based RST Parsing for Span, Nuclearity and Relation Labeling with Nondescourse Tree Structure",Pipeline-based Parsing of Discourse Trees for RST and Relation Labeling,Transition-Based Parsing of Null Discourse Trees, Transition-based Parsing of Discourse Trees,

However, the categorial formalism for which this equivalence has been established differs significantly from the versions of CCG that are in use today. In particular, it allows restriction of combinatory rules on a per grammar basis, whereas modern CCG assumes a universal set of rules, isolating all cross-linguistic variation in the lexicon. In this article we investigate the formal significance of this difference. Our main result is that lexicalized versions of the classical CCG formalism are strictly less powerful than TAG.",Lexicalization and Generative Power in CCG,,The Weak Equivalence of Combinatory Categorial Grammar and Tree-Adjoining Grammar: An Empirical,Combinatory Categorial Grammar and Tree-Adjoining Grammar: A Weak Equivalence but an Empir,Combinatory Categorial Grammar and Tree-Adjoining Grammar, Weak Equivalence of CCG and Tree-Adjoining Grammar,Lexicalized versions of the classic CCG formalism are less powerful than TAG
22,"This paper introduces a model of multipleinstance learning applied to the prediction of aspect ratings or judgments of specific properties of an item from usercontributed texts such as product reviews. Each variable-length text is represented by several independent feature vectors; one word vector per sentence or paragraph. For learning from texts with known aspect ratings, the model performs multipleinstance regression (MIR) and assigns importance weights to each of the sentences or paragraphs of a text, uncovering their contribution to the aspect ratings. Next, the model is used to predict aspect ratings in previously unseen texts, demonstrating interpretability and explanatory power for its predictions. We evaluate the model on seven multi-aspect sentiment analysis data sets, improving over four MIR baselines and two strong bag-of-words linear models, namely SVR and Lasso, by more than 10% relative in terms of MSE.",Explaining the Stars: Weighted Multiple-Instance Learning for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,MultipleInstance Learning for Aspect Rating Prediction from Texts with Known Aspects,MultipleInstance Regression for Aspect Ratings and Their Impact on Sentiment Analysis from Texts with Weercontributed Multiple-,Multiple-Instance Learning for Predicting Aspect Ratings from Texts,, Multiple Instance Regression for Aspect Rating Prediction,MultipleInstance Learning for Predicting Aspect Ratings from User-contributed Texts
23,"We present a simple approach for text infilling, the task of predicting missing spans of text at any position in a document. While infilling could enable rich functionality especially for writing assistance tools, more attention has been devoted to language modeling-a special case of infilling where text is predicted at the end of a document. In this paper, we aim to extend the capabilities of language models (LMs) to the more general task of infilling. To this end, we train (or fine tune) off-the-shelf LMs on sequences containing the concatenation of artificially-masked text and the text which was masked. We show that this approach, which we call infilling by language modeling, can enable LMs to infill entire sentences effectively on three different domains: short stories, scientific abstracts, and lyrics. Furthermore, we show that humans have difficulty identifying sentences infilled by our approach as machine-generated in the domain of short stories.",Enabling Language Models to Fill in the Blanks,Text Infilling by Language Modeling,,"Text Infilling by Language Modeling: A Case Study on Short Stories, Scientific Abstracts, and Lyrics",Language Modeling for Infilling Texts, Text Infilling with Language Modeling,Text Infilling by Language Modeling

In experiments on 16 statistical properties about countries from Freebase we show that our approach identifies simple statistical claims about properties with 60% precision, while it is able to verify these claims without requiring any explicit supervision for either tasks.

35,"In this paper, we propose a novel pretraining-based encoder-decoder framework, which can generate the output sequence based on the input sequence in a two-stage manner. For the encoder of our model, we encode the input sequence into context representations using BERT. For the decoder, there are two stages in our model, in the first stage, we use a Transformer-based decoder to generate a draft output sequence. In the second stage, we mask each word of the draft sequence and feed it to BERT, then by combining the input sequence and the draft representation generated by BERT, we use a Transformer-based decoder to predict the refined word for each masked position. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first method which applies the BERT into text generation tasks. As the first step in this direction, we evaluate our proposed method on the text summarization task.

37,"Text-based games present a unique challenge for autonomous agents to operate in natural language and handle enormous action spaces. In this paper, we propose the Contextual Action Language Model (CALM) to generate a compact set of action candidates at each game state. Our key insight is to train language models on human gameplay, where people demonstrate linguistic priors and a general game sense for promising actions conditioned on game history. We combine CALM with a reinforcement learning agent which re-ranks the generated action candidates to maximize in-game rewards. We evaluate our approach using the Jericho benchmark, on games unseen by CALM during training.

38,"Spectral clustering is one of the most popular clustering approaches. Despite its good performance, it is limited in its applicability to large-scale problems due to its high computational complexity. Recently, many approaches have been proposed to accelerate the spectral clustering. Unfortunately, these methods usually sacrifice quite a lot information of the original data, thus result in a degradation of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Landmark-based Spectral Clustering (LSC), for large scale clustering problems. Specifically, we select p ( n) representative data points as the landmarks and represent the original data points as the linear combinations of these landmarks. The spectral embedding of the data can then be efficiently computed with the landmark-based representation. The proposed algorithm scales linearly with the problem size. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach comparing to the state-of-the-art methods.",Large Scale Spectral Clustering with Landmark-Based Representation,Landmark-based Spectral Clustering for Large Scale Problems,Landmark-based Spectral Clustering: Landmark-Based Representation and Algorithm for Large-Scale Clust,Landmark-based Spectral Clustering for Large-Scale Problem Resolution,Landmark-based Spectral Clustering for Large Scale Clustering, Landmark-based Spectral Clustering for Large Scale Clustering,
39,We develop a scalable deep non-parametric generative model by augmenting deep Gaussian processes with a recognition model. Inference is performed in a novel scalable variational framework where the variational posterior distributions are reparametrized through a multilayer perceptron. The key aspect of this reformulation is that it prevents the proliferation of variational parameters which otherwise grow linearly in proportion to the sample size. We derive a new formulation of the variational lower bound that allows us to distribute most of the computation in a way that enables to handle datasets of the size of mainstream deep learning tasks. We show the efficacy of the method on a variety of challenges including deep unsupervised learning and deep Bayesian optimization.,Variational Auto-encoded Deep Gaussian Processes,,A Scalable Variational Model for Deep Gaussian Processes with a Multilayer Perceptron Reparametrized,Scalable Deep Non-parametric Generative Models via Multilayer Perceptron Reparametrizing,Scalable Deep Non-parametric Generative Models, Deep Nonparametric Generative Models,Scaling Non-Parametric Generative Models
40,Most of the current automated essay scoring (AES) systems are trained using manually graded essays from a specific prompt. These systems experience a drop in accuracy when used to grade an essay from a different prompt. Obtaining a large number of manually graded essays each time a new prompt is introduced is costly and not viable. We propose domain adaptation as a solution to adapt an AES system from an initial prompt to a new prompt. We also propose a novel domain adaptation technique that uses Bayesian linear ridge regression. We evaluate our domain adaptation technique on the publicly available Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP) dataset and show that our proposed technique is a competitive default domain adaptation algorithm for the AES task.,Flexible Domain Adaptation for Automated Essay Scoring Using Correlated Linear Regression,Domain Adaptation for Automated Essay Scoring,Domain Adaptation for Automated Essay Scoring Using Bayesian Linear-Ridge Regression using Domain Adaptation and Domain,Domain Adaptation for Automated Essay Scoring,Domain Adaptation for Automated Essay Scoring, Domain Adaptation for Automatic Essay Scoring,
41,"Evidence-based medicine is an approach whereby clinical decisions are supported by the best available findings gained from scientific research. This requires efficient access to such evidence. To this end, abstracts in evidence-based medicine can be labeled using a set of predefined medical categories, the socalled PICO criteria. This paper presents an approach to automatically annotate sentences in medical abstracts with these labels. Since both structural and sequential information are important for this classification task, we use kLog, a new language for statistical relational learning with kernels. Our results show a clear improvement with respect to state-of-the-art systems.",A Statistical Relational Learning Approach to Identifying Evidence Based Medicine Categories,Automatic Labeling of Medical Abstracts in Evidence-Based medicine,Automatic Classification of Evidence-Based Medical Abstracts Using PICO Criteria and Statistical Relational Learning with Kernels for Clinical,Automatic Classification of Abstracts in Evidence-Based Medicine Using kLog,Automatic Annotation of Sentences in Evidence-Based Medicine,,Classification of Medical Abstracts Using k-Log Kernels
42,"We present KB-UNIFY, a novel approach for integrating the output of different Open Information Extraction systems into a single unified and fully disambiguated knowledge repository. KB-UNIFY consists of three main steps: (1) disambiguation of relation argument pairs via a sensebased vector representation and a large unified sense inventory; (2) ranking of semantic relations according to their degree of specificity; (3) cross-resource relation alignment and merging based on the semantic similarity of domains and ranges. We tested KB-UNIFY on a set of four heterogeneous knowledge bases, obtaining high-quality results. We discuss and provide evaluations at each stage, and release output and evaluation data for the use and scrutiny of the community1.",Knowledge Base Unification via Sense Embeddings and Disambiguation,KB-UNIFY: A Unified and Fully Disambiguated Knowledge Base for Open Information Extraction,KB-UNIFY: Jointly Disambiguating Relation Argument Pairs and Sense-Based Representations for Open Information,KB-UNIFY: Unified Disambiguation and Alignment of Heterogeneous Knowledge Bases,KB-UNIFY: Unified and Fully Disambiguated Knowledge Repository for Open Information Extraction,,KB-UN: Integrating Open Information Extraction Systems into a Unified Knowledge Repository
43,"We introduce a novel precedence reordering approach based on a dependency parser to statistical machine translation systems. Similar to other preprocessing reordering approaches, our method can efficiently incorporate linguistic knowledge into SMT systems without increasing the complexity of decoding. For a set of five subject-object-verb (SOV) order languages, we show significant improvements in BLEU scores when translating from English, compared to other reordering approaches, in state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT systems.",Using a Dependency Parser to Improve SMT for Subject-Object-Verb Languages,A Dependency Parser for Statistical Machine Translation,Precedence Reordering Based on a Dependency Parser for Statistical Machine Translation of Subject-Object-Verb Ordering,A Dependency Parser for Pre-processing Reordering in Statistical Machine Translation,Dependency Parsing for Preprocessing Preprocessing Statistical Machine Translation Systems, Parse-Based Preference Reordering for Statistical Machine Translation,
44,"Recently research has started focusing on avoiding undesired effects that come with content moderation, such as censorship and overblocking, when dealing with hatred online. The core idea is to directly intervene in the discussion with textual responses that are meant to counter the hate content and prevent it from further spreading. Accordingly, automation strategies, such as natural language generation, are beginning to be investigated. Still, they suffer from the lack of sufficient amount of quality data and tend to produce generic/repetitive responses. Being aware of the aforementioned limitations, we present a study on how to collect responses to hate effectively, employing large scale unsupervised language models such as GPT-2 for the generation of silver data, and the best annotation strategies/neural architectures that can be used for data filtering before expert validation/post-editing.",Generating Counter Narratives against Online Hate Speech: Data and Strategies,Collecting Responses to Hate with Unsupervised Language Models,Automation Strategies to Collect Responses to Hate in Online Discussions: An Empirical Study of the Role of Content Moder,Collecting Responses to Hate: A Case Study on Unsupervised Generation of Textual Response to Hateful Content,Using Textual Responses to Hass in Online Discussion,,Collecting Responses to Hate on Social Media
45,"Most real-world document collections involve various types of metadata, such as author, source, and date, and yet the most commonly-used approaches to modeling text corpora ignore this information. While specialized models have been developed for particular applications, few are widely used in practice, as customization typically requires derivation of a custom inference algorithm. In this paper, we build on recent advances in variational inference methods and propose a general neural framework, based on topic models, to enable flexible incorporation of metadata and allow for rapid exploration of alternative models. Our approach achieves strong performance, with a manageable tradeoff between perplexity, coherence, and sparsity. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our framework through an exploration of a corpus of articles about US immigration.",Neural Models for Documents with Metadata,Variational Inference of Text Corpora with Topic Models,Neural Variational Inference for Document Collection Modelling with Topic Models: An Exploration of US News Articles about US Immigration Data,Modeling Text Corpora with Topic Models and Variational Inference,Variational Inference for Text Corpora Modeling,,Topic Models for Text Corpora with Metadata
46,"While unsupervised anaphoric zero pronoun (AZP) resolvers have recently been shown to rival their supervised counterparts in performance, it is relatively difficult to scale them up to reach the next level of performance due to the large amount of feature engineering efforts involved and their ineffectiveness in exploiting lexical features. To address these weaknesses, we propose a supervised approach to AZP resolution based on deep neural networks, taking advantage of their ability to learn useful task-specific representations and effectively exploit lexical features via word embeddings. Our approach achieves stateof-the-art performance when resolving the Chinese AZPs in the OntoNotes corpus.",Chinese Zero Pronoun Resolution with Deep Neural Networks,,Supervised Zero Pronoun Resolution with Deep Lexical Features and Word Embeddings via Word Representation Leveraging Neural Networks,Supervised Anaphoric Zero Pronoun Resolution with Deep Neural Networks,Supervised Zero Pronoun Resolution with Deep Neural Networks, Unsupervised Anaphoric Zero Pronoun Resolution with Deep Neural Networks,Supervised Anaphoric Zero Pronoun Resolution with Neural Networks
47,"Abstractive document summarization is a comprehensive task including document understanding and summary generation, in which area Transformer-based models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Compared with Transformers, topic models are better at learning explicit document semantics, and hence could be integrated into Transformers to further boost their performance. To this end, we rearrange and explore the semantics learned by a topic model, and then propose a topic assistant (TA) including three modules. TA is compatible with various Transformer-based models and user-friendly since i) TA is a plug-and-play model that does not break any structure of the original Transformer network, making users easily fine-tune Transformer+TA based on a well pre-trained model; ii) TA only introduces a small number of extra parameters. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that TA is able to improve the performance of several Transformer-based models.",Friendly Topic Assistant for Transformer Based Abstractive Summarization,Transformer-Based Abstractive Document Summarization with Topic Assistant,Topic Assistant for Transformer Summarization: A Plug-and-play Model and a Task-Oriented Topic Assistant,Topic Assistant: A Plug-and-Play Topic Model for Abstractive Document Summarization,, A Topic Assistant for Abstractive Document Summarization,Topic Assistant: A Plug-and-play Transformer for Abstractive Document Summarization
48,We use SVM classifiers to predict the next action of a deterministic parser that builds labeled projective dependency graphs in an incremental fashion.

49,"We present a novel approach to efficiently learn a label tree for large scale classification with many classes. The key contribution of the approach is a technique to simultaneously determine the structure of the tree and learn the classifiers for each node in the tree. This approach also allows fine grained control over the efficiency vs accuracy trade-off in designing a label tree, leading to more balanced trees. Experiments are performed on large scale image classification with 10184 classes and 9 million images. We demonstrate significant improvements in test accuracy and efficiency with less training time and more balanced trees compared to the previous state of the art by Bengio et al.",Fast and Balanced: Efficient Label Tree Learning for Large Scale Object Recognition,Learning Label Trees for Large Scale Image Classification with Many Classes,Efficient Learning of Label Trees for Large Scale Classification with Many Classifiers and More Balanced Tree Structure Tasks.
