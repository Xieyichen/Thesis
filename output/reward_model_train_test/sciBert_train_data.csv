0,"When a word sense disambiguation (WSD) system is trained on one domain but applied to a different domain, a drop in accuracy is frequently observed. This highlights the importance of domain adaptation for word sense disambiguation. In this paper, we first show that an active learning approach can be successfully used to perform domain adaptation of WSD systems. Then, by using the predominant sense predicted by expectation-maximization (EM) and adopting a count-merging technique, we improve the effectiveness of the original adaptation process achieved by the basic active learning approach.[SEP]Active Learning for Domain Adaptation of Word Sense Disambiguation Systems",1.0
1,"We introduce XMEANT—a new cross-lingual version of the semantic frame based MT evaluation metric MEANT—which can correlate even more closely with human adequacy judgments than monolingual MEANT and eliminates the need for expensive human references. Previous work established that MEANT reflects translation adequacy with state-of-the-art accuracy, and optimizing MT systems against MEANT robustly improves translation quality. However, to go beyond tuning weights in the loglinear SMT model, a cross-lingual objective function that can deeply integrate semantic frame criteria into the MT training pipeline is needed. We show that cross-lingual XMEANT outperforms monolingual MEANT by (1) replacing the monolingual context vector model in MEANT with simple translation probabilities, and (2) incorporating bracketing ITG con-[SEP]Cross-lingual XMEANT: A Cross-Lingual Version of the Semantic Frame based Evaluation Metric",-1.0
2,"Continuous-space translation models have recently emerged as extremely powerful ways to boost the performance of existing translation systems. A simple, yet effective way to integrate such models in inference is to use them in an N -best rescoring step. In this paper, we focus on this scenario and show that the performance gains in rescoring can be greatly increased when the neural network is trained jointly with all the other model parameters, using an appropriate objective function. Our approach is validated on two domains, where it outperforms strong baselines.[SEP]Rescoring with Joint Neural Networks for Continuous-Space Translation Models",0.0
3,"Previous work on grounded language learning did not fully capture the semantics underlying the correspondences between structured world state representations and texts, especially those between numerical values and lexical terms. In this paper, we attempt at learning explicit latent semantic annotations from paired structured tables and texts, establishing correspondences between various types of values and texts. We model the joint probability of data fields, texts, phrasal spans, and latent annotations with an adapted semi-hidden Markov model, and impose a soft statistical constraint to further improve the performance. As a by-product, we leverage the induced annotations to extract templates for language generation.

The system that we developed, SUMMONS, uses the output of systems developed for the DARPA Message Understanding Conferences to generate summaries of multiple documents on the same or related events, presenting similarities and differences, contradictions, and generalizations among sources of information. We describe the various components of the system, showing how information from multiple articles is combined, organized into a paragraph, and finally, realized as English sentences.

5,"Neural language models are a critical component of state-of-the-art systems for machine translation, summarization, audio transcription, and other tasks. These language models are almost universally autoregressive in nature, generating sentences one token at a time from left to right. This paper studies the influence of token generation order on model quality via a novel two-pass language model that produces partially-filled sentence ""templates"" and then fills in missing tokens. We compare various strategies for structuring these two passes and observe a surprisingly large variation in model quality. We find the most effective strategy generates function words in the first pass followed by content words in the second.

6,"Sentiment classification on tweets often needs to deal with the problems of under-specificity, noise, and multilingual content. This study proposes a heterogeneous multi-layer network-based representation of tweets to generate multiple representations of a tweet and address the above issues. The generated representations are further ensembled and classified using a neural-based early fusion approach. Further, we propose a centrality aware random-walk for node embedding and tweet representations suitable for the multi-layer network. From various experimental analysis, it is evident that the proposed method can address the problem of under-specificity, noisy text, and multilingual content present in a tweet and provides better classification performance than the text-based counterparts. Further, the proposed centrality aware based random walk provides better representations than unbiased and other biased counterparts.[SEP]Heterogeneous Multi-layer Network-based Representations of Tweets for Sentiment Classification",1.0

Unlike existing approaches to this task, we (1) classify an event-event or eventtime pair as one of the 14 temporal relations defined in the TimeBank corpus, rather than as one of the six relations collapsed from the original 14; (2) employ sophisticated linguistic knowledge derived from a variety of semantic and discourse relations, rather than focusing on morpho-syntactic knowledge; and (3) leverage a novel combination of rule-based and learning-based approaches, rather than relying solely on one or the other.

9,"Distinguishing speculative statements from factual ones is important for most biomedical text mining applications. We introduce an approach which is based on solving two sub-problems to identify speculative sentence fragments. The first sub-problem is identifying the speculation keywords in the sentences and the second one is resolving their linguistic scopes. We formulate the first sub-problem as a supervised classification task, where we classify the potential keywords as real speculation keywords or not by using a diverse set of linguistic features that represent the contexts of the keywords. After detecting the actual speculation keywords, we use the syntactic structures of the sentences to determine their scopes.[SEP]Identifying Speculation in Factual Texts",0.0
10,"Sentence compression techniques often assemble output sentences using fragments of lexical sequences such as ngrams or units of syntactic structure such as edges from a dependency tree representation. We present a novel approach for discriminative sentence compression that unifies these notions and jointly produces sequential and syntactic representations for output text, leveraging a compact integer linear programming formulation to maintain structural integrity. Our supervised models permit rich features over heterogeneous linguistic structures and generalize over previous state-of-theart approaches.

11,"Currently, almost all of the statistical machine translation (SMT) models are trained with the parallel corpora in some specific domains. However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality.[SEP]Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation",1.0

We present an alternative, dependency-based perspective on linguistic meaning and situate it in the computational setting. This perspective is formalized in terms of hybrid logic and has a rich yet perspicuous propositional ontology that enables a wide variety of semantic phenomena to be represented in a single meaning formalism.

While operating at the character level, the model makes use of wordlevel and contextual information. In contrast to previous work, the proposed approach learns to correct a variety of error types without guidance of manuallyselected constraints or language-specific features.

We propose a method termed “robust Dantzig selector” which can successfully identify the clustering structure even with the presence of irrelevant features. The idea is simple yet powerful: we replace the inner product by its robust counterpart, which is insensitive to the irrelevant features given an upper bound of the number of irrelevant features. We establish theoretical guarantees for the algorithm to identify the correct subspace, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm via numerical simulations.

18,"We present two language models based upon an “immediate-head” parser — our name for a parser that conditions all events below a constituent c upon the head of c. While all of the most accurate statistical parsers are of the immediate-head variety, no previous grammatical language model uses this technology. The perplexity for both of these models significantly improve upon the trigram model base-line as well as the best previous grammarbased language model. For the better of our two models these improvements are 24% and 14% respectively. We also suggest that improvement of the underlying parser should significantly improve the model’s perplexity and that even in the near term there is a lot of potential for improvement in immediatehead language models.[SEP]Improvements in an Immediate-Head Language Model Based on a Grammatical Parser",-1.0
19,"It is usually assumed that the kind of noise existing in annotated data is random classification noise. Yet there is evidence that differences between annotators are not always random attention slips but could result from different biases towards the classification categories, at least for the harder-to-decide cases. Under an annotation generation model that takes this into account, there is a hazard that some of the training instances are actually hard cases with unreliable annotations. We show that these are relatively unproblematic for an algorithm operating under the 0-1 loss model, whereas for the commonly used voted perceptron algorithm, hard training cases could result in incorrect prediction on the uncontroversial cases at test time.[SEP] Random Attention Slippage in Annotation",-1.0

21,"The task of inferring the native language of an author based on texts written in a second language has generally been tackled as a classification problem, typically using as features a mix of n-grams over characters and part of speech tags (for small and fixed n) and unigram function words. To capture arbitrarily long n-grams that syntax-based approaches have suggested are useful, adaptor grammars have some promise. In this work we investigate their extension to identifying n-gram collocations of arbitrary length over a mix of PoS tags and words, using both maxent and induced syntactic language model approaches to classification. After presenting a new, simple baseline, we show that learned collocations used as features in a maxent model perform better still, but that the story is more mixed for the syntactic language model.[SEP] Adaptor Grammars for Native Language Acquisition",1.0
22,"One major challenge in training Deep Neural Networks is preventing overfitting. Many techniques such as data augmentation and novel regularizers such as Dropout have been proposed to prevent overfitting without requiring a massive amount of training data. In this work, we propose a new regularizer called DeCov which leads to significantly reduced overfitting (as indicated by the difference between train and val performance), and better generalization. Our regularizer encourages diverse or non-redundant representations in Deep Neural Networks by minimizing the cross-covariance of hidden activations. This simple intuition has been explored in a number of past works but surprisingly has never been applied as a regularizer in supervised learning. Experiments across a range of datasets and network architectures show that this loss always reduces overfitting while almost always maintaining or increasing generalization performance and often improving performance over Dropout.[SEP]DeCov: Regularizing Deep Neural Networks for Overfitting",1.0
23,"This paper presents an approach for Multilingual Document Clustering in comparable corpora. The algorithm is of heuristic nature and it uses as unique evidence for clustering the identification of cognate named entities between both sides of the comparable corpora. One of the main advantages of this approach is that it does not depend on bilingual or multilingual resources. However, it depends on the possibility of identifying cognate named entities between the languages used in the corpus. An additional advantage of the approach is that it does not need any information about the right number of clusters; the algorithm calculates it. We have tested this approach with a comparable corpus of news written in English and Spanish. In addition, we have compared the results with a system which translates selected document features. The obtained results are encouraging.[SEP]Multilingual Document Clustering: An Heuristic Approach Based on Cognate Named Entities",0.3333333333333333

Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance of both Dropout and DropConnect.

26,"Zero-shot translation, translating between language pairs on which a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system has never been trained, is an emergent property when training the system in multilingual settings. However, naive training for zero-shot NMT easily fails, and is sensitive to hyper-parameter setting. The performance typically lags far behind the more conventional pivot-based approach which translates twice using a third language as a pivot. In this work, we address the degeneracy problem due to capturing spurious correlations by quantitatively analyzing the mutual information between language IDs of the source and decoded sentences. Inspired by this analysis, we propose to use two simple but effective approaches: (1) decoder pre-training; (2) back-translation. These methods show significant improvement (4 22 BLEU points) over the vanilla zero-shot translation on three challenging multilingual datasets, and achieve similar or better results than the pivot-based approach.[SEP]Null-Shot Translation with Decoder Pre-training and Back-Translation",-1.0

A compiler is described which translates a set of lexical rules and their interaction into a definite clause encoding, which is called by the base lexical entries in the lexicon. This way, the disjunctive possibilities arising from lexical rule application are encoded as systematic covariation in the specification of lexical entries. The compiler ensures the automatic transfer of properties not changed by a lexical rule. Program transformation techniques are used to advance the encoding. The final output of the compiler constitutes an efficient computational counterpart of the linguistic generalizations captured by lexical rules and allows on-the-fly application of lexical rules.[SEP]A Computational Treatment of Lexical Rules and their Interactions",1.0

By leveraging the optimal transport distance, we introduce a regularizer that significantly alleviates the above issues. Our formulation emphasizes the preservation of semantic features, enabling end-to-end training instead of ad-hoc fine-tuning, and when combined with RL, it controls the exploration space for more efficient model updates.

The learned bases provide a set of anchor points to form a local coordinate system, such that each data point x on the manifold can be locally approximated by a linear combination of its nearby anchor points, and the linear weights become its local coordinate coding. We show that a high dimensional nonlinear function can be approximated by a global linear function with respect to this coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured by the locality of such coding. The method turns a difficult nonlinear learning problem into a simple global linear learning problem, which overcomes some drawbacks of traditional local learning methods.[SEP] Semi-Supervised Learning on High Dimensional Nonlinear Manifolds",-1.0

However, due to the incompleteness of provided synonyms and numerous variations in their surface forms, normalization of biomedical entities is very challenging. In this paper, we focus on learning representations of biomedical entities solely based on the synonyms of entities. To learn from the incomplete synonyms, we use a model-based candidate selection and maximize the marginal likelihood of the synonyms present in top candidates. Our model-based candidates are iteratively updated to contain more difficult negative samples as our model evolves. In this way, we avoid the explicit pre-selection of negative samples from more than 400K candidates.

We formulate cross-domain semantic parsing as a domain adaptation problem: train a semantic parser on some source domains and then adapt it to the target domain. Due to the diversity of logical forms in different domains, this problem presents unique and intriguing challenges. By converting logical forms into canonical utterances in natural language, we reduce semantic parsing to paraphrasing, and develop an attentive sequence-to-sequence paraphrase model that is general and flexible to adapt to different domains. We discover two problems, small micro variance and large macro variance, of pre-trained word embeddings that hinder their direct use in neural networks, and propose standardization techniques as a remedy.

This makes the measures unreliable and unfair when the number of clusters produced by different systems vary and the sample size is not exceedingly large. This corresponds exactly to the setting of WSI evaluation where a ground-truth cluster sense number arguably does not exist and the standard evaluation scenarios use a small number of instances of each word to compute the score.

51,"Machine learning promises methods that generalize well from finite labeled data. However, the brittleness of existing neural net approaches is revealed by notable failures, such as the existence of adversarial examples that are misclassified despite being nearly identical to a training example, or the inability of recurrent sequence-processing nets to stay on track without teacher forcing. We introduce a method, which we refer to as state reification, that involves modeling the distribution of hidden states over the training data and then projecting hidden states observed during testing toward this distribution. Our intuition is that if the network can remain in a familiar manifold of hidden space, subsequent layers of the net should be well trained to respond appropriately. We show that this state-reification method helps neural nets to generalize better, especially when labeled data are sparse, and also helps overcome the challenge of achieving robust generalization with adversarial training.[SEP]State-Reification Networks: Improving Generalization by Modeling the Distribution of Hidden Representations",1.0

While recent work has combined these word embeddings with hand crafted features for improved performance, it was restricted to a small number of features due to model complexity, thus limiting its applicability. We propose a new model that conjoins features and word embeddings while maintaing a small number of parameters by learning feature embeddings jointly with the parameters of a compositional model. The result is a method that can scale to more features and more labels, while avoiding overfitting. We demonstrate that our model attains state-of-the-art results on ACE and ERE fine-grained relation extraction.[SEP]Combining Features and Word Embeddings for Compositional Representation Learning",1.0

We use existing and novel similarity measures that aim to gauge the level of localization of information in the deep models, and facilitate the investigation of which design factors affect model similarity, without requiring any external linguistic annotation. The analysis reveals that models within the same family are more similar to one another, as may be expected. Surprisingly, different architectures have rather similar representations, but different individual neurons. We also observed differences in information localization in lower and higher layers and found that higher layers are more affected by fine-tuning on downstream tasks.[SEP]Similarity Analysis of Contextual Word Representations: A Case Study on Information Localization in the Lens of Similarity Analysis.",-1.0

To learn from the incomplete synonyms, we use a model-based candidate selection and maximize the marginal likelihood of the synonyms present in top candidates. Our model-based candidates are iteratively updated to contain more difficult negative samples as our model evolves. In this way, we avoid the explicit pre-selection of negative samples from more than 400K candidates.

We therefore propose an automatic approach for extracting challenge sets rich with long-distance dependencies, and argue that evaluation using this methodology provides a complementary perspective on system performance. To support our claim, we compile challenge sets for English-German and German-English, which are much larger than any previously released challenge set for MT.

It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary.

Here we used a model order identification method to avoid the misclassification of the instances with undefined senses by discovering new senses from mixed data (tagged and untagged corpora). This algorithm tries to obtain a natural partition of the mixed data by maximizing a stability criterion defined on the classification result from an extended label propagation algorithm over all the possible values of the number of senses (or sense number, model order).

By leveraging the optimal transport distance, we introduce a regularizer that significantly alleviates the above issues. Our formulation emphasizes the preservation of semantic features, enabling end-to-end training instead of ad-hoc fine-tuning, and when combined with RL, it controls the exploration space for more efficient model updates.

We believe such high precision is crucial for real-world NLP applications and thus our method is preferable to the state-of-the-art method.[SEP]A Multi-column Convolutional Neural Network for Zero Anaphora Resolution in Japanese",-1.0

Higher layers include shortcut connections to lower-level task predictions to reflect linguistic hierarchies. We use a simple regularization term to allow for optimizing all model weights to improve one task's loss without exhibiting catastrophic interference of the other tasks.

We compare two estimators for this latent-variable model: one based on EM and the other is a spectral algorithm based on the method of moments. We evaluate their performance on a Chinese–English translation task.

Previous models rely heavily on richer syntactic information through lexicalizing rules, splitting categories, or memorizing long histories. However enriched models incur numerous parameters and sparsity issues, and are insufficient for capturing various syntactic phenomena. We propose a neural network structure that explicitly models the unbounded history of actions performed on the stack and queue employed in transition-based parsing, in addition to the representations of partially parsed tree structure. Our transition-based neural constituent parsing achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art parsers, demonstrating F1 score of 90.68% for English and 84.33% for Chinese, without reranking, feature templates or additional data to train model parameters.[SEP]Transition-based Neural Constituent Parsing with Rich Syntactic Structures and Memory of Long Heterosyllabic",-1.0

Such measures rely on sample-based estimates of the entropy. However, the standard maximum likelihood estimates of the entropy are heavily biased with the bias dependent on, among other things, the number of clusters and the sample size. This makes the measures unreliable and unfair when the number of clusters produced by different systems vary and the sample size is not exceedingly large. This corresponds exactly to the setting of WSI evaluation where a ground-truth cluster sense number arguably does not exist and the standard evaluation scenarios use a small number of instances of each word to compute the score. We describe more accurate entropy estimators and analyze their performance both in simulations and on evaluation of WSI systems.[SEP]Improved Estimation of Entropy for Evaluation of Word Sense Induction",1.0

In this work, we conduct an initial attempt to answer these questions on two related subsequent tasks: semantic slot filling in spoken language understanding and named entity recognition. We propose three techniques to solve the mismatch problem: using word segmentation outputs as additional features, adaptation with partial-learning and taking advantage of n-best word segmentation list.

We show that a high dimensional nonlinear function can be approximated by a global linear function with respect to this coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured by the locality of such coding.

To achieve high parsing performance for spoken monologues, it could prove effective to simplify the structure by dividing a sentence into suitable language units. This paper proposes a method for dependency parsing of Japanese monologues based on sentence segmentation. In this method, the dependency parsing is executed in two stages: at the clause level and the sentence level. First, the dependencies within a clause are identified by dividing a sentence into clauses and executing stochastic dependency parsing for each clause. Next, the dependencies over clause boundaries are identified stochastically, and the dependency structure of the entire sentence is thus completed.

285,"Semantic grammars can be applied both as a language model for a speech recognizer and for semantic parsing, e.g. in order to map the output of a speech recognizer into formal meaning representations. Semantic speech recognition grammars are, however, typically created manually or learned in a supervised fashion, requiring extensive manual effort in both cases. Aiming to reduce this effort, in this paper we investigate the induction of semantic speech recognition grammars under weak supervision. We present empirical results, indicating that the induced grammars support semantic parsing of speech with a rather low loss in performance when compared to parsing of input without recognition errors. Further, we show improved parsing performance compared to applying n-gram models as language models and demonstrate how our semantic speech recognition grammars can be enhanced by weights based on occurrence frequencies, yielding an improvement in parsing performance over applying unweighted grammars.[SEP]Semantic parsing of speech using grammars learned with weak supervision",0.0
286,"Much of human dialogue occurs in semi-cooperative settings, where agents with different goals attempt to agree on common decisions. Negotiations require complex communication and reasoning skills, but success is easy to measure, making this an interesting task for AI. We gather a large dataset of human-human negotiations on a multi-issue bargaining task, where agents who cannot observe each other's reward functions must reach an agreement (or a deal) via natural language dialogue. For the first time, we show it is possible to train end-to-end models for negotiation, which must learn both linguistic and reasoning skills with no annotated dialogue states. We also introduce dialogue rollouts, in which the model plans ahead by simulating possible complete continuations of the conversation, and find that this technique dramatically improves performance.

In this paper, we propose a simple technique to improve a generalization ability of deep RL agents by introducing a randomized (convolutional) neural network that randomly perturbs input observations. It enables trained agents to adapt to new domains by learning robust features invariant across varied and randomized environments. Furthermore, we consider an inference method based on the Monte Carlo approximation to reduce the variance induced by this randomization. We demonstrate the superiority of our method across 2D CoinRun, 3D DeepMind Lab exploration and 3D robotics control tasks: it significantly outperforms various regularization and data augmentation methods for the same purpose.

By converting logical forms into canonical utterances in natural language, we reduce semantic parsing to paraphrasing, and develop an attentive sequence-to-sequence paraphrase model that is general and flexible to adapt to different domains. We discover two problems, small micro variance and large macro variance, of pre-trained word embeddings that hinder their direct use in neural networks, and propose standardization techniques as a remedy.

We make our discussion concrete by introducing the task of Tense Sense Disambiguation (TSD): given a concrete tense syntactic form present in a sentence, select its appropriate sense among a set of possible senses. Using English grammar textbooks, we compiled a syntactic sense dictionary comprising common tense syntactic forms and semantic senses for each.

To achieve high parsing performance for spoken monologues, it could prove effective to simplify the structure by dividing a sentence into suitable language units.

In this method, the dependency parsing is executed in two stages: at the clause level and the sentence level. First, the dependencies within a clause are identified by dividing a sentence into clauses and executing stochastic dependency parsing for each clause. Next, the dependencies over clause boundaries are identified stochastically, and the dependency structure of the entire sentence is thus completed.

Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance of both Dropout and DropConnect.

We introduce a method, which we refer to as state reification, that involves modeling the distribution of hidden states over the training data and then projecting hidden states observed during testing toward this distribution. Our intuition is that if the network can remain in a familiar manifold of hidden space, subsequent layers of the net should be well trained to respond appropriately.

Unlike previous approaches to this task, the current method is not corpus-based, but rather makes use of the principles of early Government-Binding theory (Chomsky, 1981), the syntactic theory that underlies the annotation. Using the evaluation metric proposed by Johnson (2002), this approach outperforms previously published approaches on both detection of empty categories and antecedent identification, given either annotated input stripped of empty categories or the output of a parser.

This solution, however, is computationally very demanding, so we suggest a procedure to get an approximate solution for a given number of hidden units. The weights obtained for the linear autoencoder are then used as initial weights for the inputto-hidden connections of a recurrent neural network, which is then trained on the desired task.

Aiming to reduce this effort, in this paper we investigate the induction of semantic speech recognition grammars under weak supervision. We present empirical results, indicating that the induced grammars support semantic parsing of speech with a rather low loss in performance when compared to parsing of input without recognition errors. Further, we show improved parsing performance compared to applying n-gram models as language models and demonstrate how our semantic speech recognition grammars can be enhanced by weights based on occurrence frequencies, yielding an improvement in parsing performance over applying unweighted grammars.[SEP]Weakly Supervised Induction of Semantic Speech Recognition Grammars",-1.0

To achieve high parsing performance for spoken monologues, it could prove effective to simplify the structure by dividing a sentence into suitable language units. This paper proposes a method for dependency parsing of Japanese monologues based on sentence segmentation. In this method, the dependency parsing is executed in two stages: at the clause level and the sentence level. First, the dependencies within a clause are identified by dividing a sentence into clauses and executing stochastic dependency parsing for each clause. Next, the dependencies over clause boundaries are identified stochastically, and the dependency structure of the entire sentence is thus completed. An experiment using a spoken monologue corpus shows this method to be effective for efficient dependency parsing of Japanese monologue sentences.[SEP]Dependency Parsing of Japanese Monologue Sentences Using Sentence Segmentation and Stochastic Dependency Parser",-1.0

We introduce a method, which we refer to as state reification, that involves modeling the distribution of hidden states over the training data and then projecting hidden states observed during testing toward this distribution. Our intuition is that if the network can remain in a familiar manifold of hidden space, subsequent layers of the net should be well trained to respond appropriately.

427,"It is usually assumed that the kind of noise existing in annotated data is random classification noise. Yet there is evidence that differences between annotators are not always random attention slips but could result from different biases towards the classification categories, at least for the harder-to-decide cases. Under an annotation generation model that takes this into account, there is a hazard that some of the training instances are actually hard cases with unreliable annotations. We show that these are relatively unproblematic for an algorithm operating under the 0-1 loss model, whereas for the commonly used voted perceptron algorithm, hard training cases could result in incorrect prediction on the uncontroversial cases at test time.[SEP]Hard Training Cases with Unreliable Annotation Generation",1.0

However, the brittleness of existing neural net approaches is revealed by notable failures, such as the existence of adversarial examples that are misclassified despite being nearly identical to a training example, or the inability of recurrent sequence-processing nets to stay on track without teacher forcing. We introduce a method, which we refer to as state reification, that involves modeling the distribution of hidden states over the training data and then projecting hidden states observed during testing toward this distribution. Our intuition is that if the network can remain in a familiar manifold of hidden space, subsequent layers of the net should be well trained to respond appropriately. We show that this state-reification method helps neural nets to generalize better, especially when labeled data are sparse, and also helps overcome the challenge of achieving robust generalization with adversarial training.[SEP]State Reification for Robust Neural Net Generalization with Adversarial Training of Finite-Labeled Data via Hidden State",0.0

But the traditional NMF method and other existing variants of NMF do not consider this. This paper proposes a novel clustering algorithm that explicitly models the intrinsic geometrical structure of the data on multiple manifolds with NMF.

In this work we propose an interactive learning procedure called Mechanical Turker Descent (MTD) and use it to train agents to execute natural language commands grounded in a fantasy text adventure game. In MTD, Turkers compete to train better agents in the short term, and collaborate by sharing their agents’ skills in the long term. This results in a gamified, engaging experience for the Turkers and a better quality teaching signal for the agents compared to static datasets, as the Turkers naturally adapt the training data to the agent’s abilities.[SEP]Turker Descent: Interactively Learning to execute Natural Language commands in a Fantasy Game",1.0
473,"Existing studies on semantic parsing mainly focus on the in-domain setting. We formulate cross-domain semantic parsing as a domain adaptation problem: train a semantic parser on some source domains and then adapt it to the target domain. Due to the diversity of logical forms in different domains, this problem presents unique and intriguing challenges. By converting logical forms into canonical utterances in natural language, we reduce semantic parsing to paraphrasing, and develop an attentive sequence-to-sequence paraphrase model that is general and flexible to adapt to different domains. We discover two problems, small micro variance and large macro variance, of pre-trained word embeddings that hinder their direct use in neural networks, and propose standardization techniques as a remedy. On the popular Overnight dataset, which contains eight domains, we show that both cross-domain training and standardized pre-trained word embeddings can bring significant improvement.[SEP]Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing as a Domain adaptation problem",0.0

The compiler ensures the automatic transfer of properties not changed by a lexical rule. Program transformation techniques are used to advance the encoding.

To achieve high parsing performance for spoken monologues, it could prove effective to simplify the structure by dividing a sentence into suitable language units. This paper proposes a method for dependency parsing of Japanese monologues based on sentence segmentation. In this method, the dependency parsing is executed in two stages: at the clause level and the sentence level. First, the dependencies within a clause are identified by dividing a sentence into clauses and executing stochastic dependency parsing for each clause. Next, the dependencies over clause boundaries are identified stochastically, and the dependency structure of the entire sentence is thus completed.

Our regularizer encourages diverse or non-redundant representations in Deep Neural Networks by minimizing the cross-covariance of hidden activations. This simple intuition has been explored in a number of past works but surprisingly has never been applied as a regularizer in supervised learning.

By converting logical forms into canonical utterances in natural language, we reduce semantic parsing to paraphrasing, and develop an attentive sequence-to-sequence paraphrase model that is general and flexible to adapt to different domains. We discover two problems, small micro variance and large macro variance, of pre-trained word embeddings that hinder their direct use in neural networks, and propose standardization techniques as a remedy.

By converting logical forms into canonical utterances in natural language, we reduce semantic parsing to paraphrasing, and develop an attentive sequence-to-sequence paraphrase model that is general and flexible to adapt to different domains. We discover two problems, small micro variance and large macro variance, of pre-trained word embeddings that hinder their direct use in neural networks, and propose standardization techniques as a remedy.

While operating at the character level, the model makes use of wordlevel and contextual information. In contrast to previous work, the proposed approach learns to correct a variety of error types without guidance of manuallyselected constraints or language-specific features.

709,"Supervised and semi-supervised sense disambiguation methods will mis-tag the instances of a target word if the senses of these instances are not defined in sense inventories or there are no tagged instances for these senses in training data. Here we used a model order identification method to avoid the misclassification of the instances with undefined senses by discovering new senses from mixed data (tagged and untagged corpora). This algorithm tries to obtain a natural partition of the mixed data by maximizing a stability criterion defined on the classification result from an extended label propagation algorithm over all the possible values of the number of senses (or sense number, model order). Experimental results on SENSEVAL-3 data indicate that it outperforms SVM, a one-class partially supervised classification algorithm, and a clustering based model order identification algorithm when the tagged data is incomplete.[SEP]Model Order Identification for Undefined Sentiment Disambiguation",-1.0

In contrast to the dominant approach in the literature, the system does not rely on translation rules, but treat translation as an unconstrained target sentence generation task, using soft features to capture lexical and syntactic correspondences between the source and target languages. Target syntax features and bilingual translation features are trained consistently in a discriminative model.

Since most dependencies are short-distance, common evaluation metrics will be little influenced by how well systems perform on them. We therefore propose an automatic approach for extracting challenge sets rich with long-distance dependencies, and argue that evaluation using this methodology provides a complementary perspective on system performance. To support our claim, we compile challenge sets for English-German and German-English, which are much larger than any previously released challenge set for MT. The extracted sets are large enough to allow reliable automatic evaluation, which makes the proposed approach a scalable and practical solution for evaluating MT performance on the long-tail of syntactic phenomena.[SEP]Evaluating Machine Translation with Long-distance Dependencies: An Automatic Approach to the State-of-the-Art Trans",-1.0

This paper addresses methods for creating a lexicon of such events, to support such work on opinion inference. Due to significant sense ambiguity, our goal is to develop a sense-level rather than word-level lexicon. To maximize the effectiveness of different types of information, we combine a graph-based method using WordNet1 relations and a standard classifier using gloss information. A hybrid between the two gives the best results. Further, we provide evidence that the model is an effective way to guide manual annotation to find +/-effect senses that are not in the seed set.[SEP] A Sense-Level Lexicon for Opinion Inference",-1.0

In MTD, Turkers compete to train better agents in the short term, and collaborate by sharing their agents’ skills in the long term.

A setting of particular interest is when the clients are mobile devices, where two important concerns are communication efficiency and the privacy of the clients. Several recent works have focused on reducing the communication cost or introducing privacy guarantees, but none of the proposed communication efficient methods are known to be privacy preserving and none of the known privacy mechanisms are known to be communication efficient. To this end, we study algorithms that achieve both communication efficiency and differential privacy. For d variables and n ⇡ d clients, the proposed method uses O(log log(nd)) bits of communication per client per coordinate and ensures constant privacy.

When other learning techniques (symbolic or statistical) are widely used in Natural Language Learning, few applications use theory refinement (Abecker and Schmid, 1996), (Mooney, 1993). We would like to show that even a basic implementation of notions used in TR is enough to build an efficient machine learning system concerning the task of learning linguistic structures. ALLiS relies on the use of background knowledge and default values in order to build up an initial grammar and on the use of theory refinement in order to improve this grammar. This combination provides a good machine learning framework (efficient and fast) for Natural Language Learning. After presenting theory refinement (Section 2) and a general description of ALLiS (Section 3), we will show how each step of TR is applying in the specific case of learning linguistic structures (non-recursive phrases).[SEP]AlliS: A Machine Learning System for Syntactic Structures Using Theory Refinement",1.0

Thus, the utility of dropout can be regarded as decreasing interactions to alleviate the significance of over-fitting.

To achieve high parsing performance for spoken monologues, it could prove effective to simplify the structure by dividing a sentence into suitable language units. This paper proposes a method for dependency parsing of Japanese monologues based on sentence segmentation. In this method, the dependency parsing is executed in two stages: at the clause level and the sentence level. First, the dependencies within a clause are identified by dividing a sentence into clauses and executing stochastic dependency parsing for each clause. Next, the dependencies over clause boundaries are identified stochastically, and the dependency structure of the entire sentence is thus completed.

Many techniques such as data augmentation and novel regularizers such as Dropout have been proposed to prevent overfitting without requiring a massive amount of training data. In this work, we propose a new regularizer called DeCov which leads to significantly reduced overfitting (as indicated by the difference between train and val performance), and better generalization. Our regularizer encourages diverse or non-redundant representations in Deep Neural Networks by minimizing the cross-covariance of hidden activations. This simple intuition has been explored in a number of past works but surprisingly has never been applied as a regularizer in supervised learning.

It approximates the nonnegative data in an original high dimensional space with a linear representation in a low dimensional space by using the product of two nonnegative matrices.

But the traditional NMF method and other existing variants of NMF do not consider this. This paper proposes a novel clustering algorithm that explicitly models the intrinsic geometrical structure of the data on multiple manifolds with NMF. The idea of the proposed algorithm is that a data point generated by several neighboring points on a specific manifold in the original space should be constructed in a similar way in the low dimensional subspace.
