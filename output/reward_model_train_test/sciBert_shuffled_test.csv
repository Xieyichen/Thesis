6,"This paper investigates contextual word representation models from the lens of similarity analysis. Given a collection of trained models, we measure the similarity of their internal representations and attention. Critically, these models come from vastly different architectures. We use existing and novel similarity measures that aim to gauge the level of localization of information in the deep models, and facilitate the investigation of which design factors affect model similarity, without requiring any external linguistic annotation. The analysis reveals that models within the same family are more similar to one another, as may be expected. Surprisingly, different architectures have rather similar representations, but different individual neurons. We also observed differences in information localization in lower and higher layers and found that higher layers are more affected by fine-tuning on downstream tasks.[SEP]Similarity Analysis of Contextual Word Representation Models",1.0

Existing models for this setting sample new descriptions at test time and use those to classify images.

Motivated by Centering Theory and other previous works, we exploit as clues both the surface word sequence and the dependency tree of a target sentence in our MCNN. Even though the F-score of our method was lower than that of the state-of-the-art method, which achieved relatively high recall and low precision, our method achieved much higher precision (>0.8) in a wide range of recall levels.

30,"Much of human dialogue occurs in semi-cooperative settings, where agents with different goals attempt to agree on common decisions. Negotiations require complex communication and reasoning skills, but success is easy to measure, making this an interesting task for AI. We gather a large dataset of human-human negotiations on a multi-issue bargaining task, where agents who cannot observe each other's reward functions must reach an agreement (or a deal) via natural language dialogue. For the first time, we show it is possible to train end-to-end models for negotiation, which must learn both linguistic and reasoning skills with no annotated dialogue states.

54,"The task of inferring the native language of an author based on texts written in a second language has generally been tackled as a classification problem, typically using as features a mix of n-grams over characters and part of speech tags (for small and fixed n) and unigram function words. To capture arbitrarily long n-grams that syntax-based approaches have suggested are useful, adaptor grammars have some promise. In this work we investigate their extension to identifying n-gram collocations of arbitrary length over a mix of PoS tags and words, using both maxent and induced syntactic language model approaches to classification.

They suggested that the Range of Skill of a typical natural game is a small number, but only gave heuristic arguments for this. In this paper, we provide the first methods for rigorously estimating the Range of Skill of a given game. We provide some general, asymptotic bounds that imply that the Range of Skill of a perfectly balanced game tree is almost exponential in its size (and doubly exponential in its depth). We also provide techniques that yield concrete bounds for unbalanced game trees and apply these to estimate the Range of Skill of Tic-Tac-Toe and Heads-Up Limit Texas Hold’em Poker.

We demonstrate that, when done right, adjoining improves translation quality without becoming computationally intractable. Using adjoining to model optionality allows general translation patterns to be learned without the clutter of endless variations of optional material. The appropriate modifiers can later be spliced in as needed. In this paper, we describe a novel method for learning a type of Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammar and associated probabilities from aligned tree/string training data. We introduce a method of converting these grammars to a weakly equivalent tree transducer for decoding.
